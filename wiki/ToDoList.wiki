= What we strive for =

We as developers and contributors must strive for the following:
 * In all Wiki articles, commit messages and other areas we must keep the English used at a flawless and professional level
 * We must always thoroughly test our changes before committing them
 * We must always attempt to in detail explain changes that we commit
 * We must never in public attack or blame authors of previous revisions
 * We must, however, be honest, neutral and level-headed at all times
