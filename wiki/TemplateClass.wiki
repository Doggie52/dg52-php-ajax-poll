#summary Description of how the template class will look.

== Introduction ==

Below I will outline, for both yours' and my sake, generally how I will design the class controlling templates and the UI and how the structure of these will look.

The reason I am adding a template class is simply because I feel there needs to be an easy way to change the appearance of the poll - as it looks right now it's all stored inside PHP-files making editing and styling an enormous hassle.

The final purpose with the class is to make the poll entirely style-able.

= General Structure =

== `class Template` ==
This class will hold all functions, references to template files and configuration files and the variables.

== `.tmpl` Files ==
These files will contain all the HTML code that builds the user interface, as well as variables (in the following form: `%VARIABLES`) that are replaced with definitions upon loading the template file.
